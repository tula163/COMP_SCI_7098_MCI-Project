Recommendation System

# Abstract
Recommendation systems have become indispensable across various domains, such as social networking , e-commerce, and digital marketing, by offering personalized suggestions and user-centric feedback. However, achieving high accuracy and reliability in these systems remains a critical challenge. This project aims to develop an AI-driven recommendation system designed to deliver precise and context-aware recommendations tailored to individual user requirements. The approach involves generating synthetic data, selecting three leading AI models from existing research, training and testing these models, and conducting a comparative performance analysis based on accuracy. The evaluation will be conducted using a dataset of Australian Migration Agents, with the objective of effectively matching migrants to suitable migration agents based on their unique requirements and preferences.

# Document organizaton
1. Agendas: stored in docs/Agendas/
2. Minutes: stored in docs/Minutes/
3. Timesheets: stored in docs/Timesheets/
4. Output documents for each week, such as report slides, table images and prototypes: store in docs/Report/, with a folder name with the week number.
5. Data files: stored in datafiles/, named with a specific title, for example, Migrant requirements.csv.
6. Back-end codes: stored in BackCode/ after testing and merging on the main branch.
7. Front-end codes: stored in front-end/ after testing and merging on the main branch.
8. Codes management: Firstly, we should create a branch named after our name and push the codes on this branch. After testing on local devices, the codes will be merged into the main branch to continue future testing.
9. Document sharing: use Microsoft 365 to share all the editable documents, such as slides, Word and Excel, which can help members monitor and check each other and facilitate cooperation.
